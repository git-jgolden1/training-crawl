energy management
  where does it come from?
    dungeon core generates energy for the dungeon
      always one color
  tiers 0-3
    1 tier 3 = 10 tier 2 = 100 tier 1 = 1000 tier 0
  energy types
    lumina
      White (tier 3)
        connects to any spectra
        element = life
      lighT gray (tier 2)
        connects to any etherea
        element = light
      dArk gray (tier 1)
        connects to any spectra or black
        element = shadow
      blacK (tier 0)
        connects to any interna
        element = death
    etherea (tier 3)
      Diamond

    spectra (tier 2)
      violet
        element = electric
      indigo
        element = stone

        element = water

      critical_health (from violet)
      major_health (from green)
      minor_health (from red)
      stamina (from orange)
      mana (from yellow)
  energy can flow both directions, but favors down (2x pressure on top)
  willpower can be used to concentrate energy against the normal forces
    effectively reduces the pressure of the targeted energy pool
      1/2 = 1 willpower per aut
      1/3 = 2 willpower per aut
      1/4 = 3 willpower per aut
      1/5 = 4 willpower per aut
      can only be applied to energy pools, not interna
    willpower slowly charges over time
  humans have a single spectra core, which continuously generates energy of that color
    with normal adventure mode, spectra core isn't identified until later in the game (when magic awakening happens)
      a second awakening may be possible, based on intelligence
    ? with creature selection mode, spectra core may be chosen at the beginning, along with species, etc
  energy should not pass from one pool to another unless the result would make the pressure difference lower
  energy passes through cells of the dungeon
    each cell may have containers for one or more energy types
    adjacent cells are connected, and based on the cell flow rate, can share energy
    levels have an energy core, unless it is dug up
    plants derive energy from the floor
    some kinds of energy can spawn monsters
    some plants can convert one type of energy to another
    some creatures convert energy
    energy capacity of plants is lower than animals
eat
  starvation constantly attempts to deplete HP, MP, SP (not WP)
    red, orange, yellow energy is consumed to counter this, unless there is no energy available, in which case hp is lost
    there is an idle rate that these deplete, although it is slow
    HP = 0 : dead
    MP = 0 : occasional confusion
    SP = 0 : occasional fainting
  critical health must be at max before major healing can happen
  major health must be at max before minor healing can happen
  normally major damage isn't done until minor health is 0
  all 100/100/100 of 250
  or 1/2 minor 1/4 major 1/4 critical
  or 2/3 minor 1/3 of remaining major + critical, 1/3 of remaining critical
  all health must be 0 before death occurs
  critical strikes can bypass the normal damage order

  rings =:
    attribute: boost that attribute

shops
  fixed shops
  monsters can't enter
  dropping item onto floor sells it
  picking item up buys it
  They can buy and sell, but price is based on demand
    price of every item is based on how many are held by shops throughout the dungeon
    the more of a given type of item, the cheaper it is
    if you sell an item, that item's price becomes lower, since there is more supply. But calculated price is what the value is after it was sold, making re-buy price = sell price
    sell price != buy price for a single item at one time
  merchants occupy real level space: 
    1/2   3x3
    1/4   4x4
    1/8   5x5
    1/16  6x6
    1/32  7x7
    1/64  8x8
    1/64  9x9
    <5x5 is usually a speciality store
    >=5x5 is usually a general store (although there's a small chance of the opposite)
  buy, then reselling must always be the same price
  total price is product of several factors
    rarity based: (rarity_factor = (1 + count of that type) / total_items_spawned)
      item class: potion, weapon, armor, scroll...
      item type: spear, axe, dagger...
      item enhancement level: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
      item brand: fire, ice, none
    scale based: (rarity_factor = 1/(1+level))
      item level
      item charge
      socket count
    inverting the product of the rarity_factors gives the actual price of the product
  every 3 floors should have a store
  every 3 stores should be a mega-store
    either a large store (6+)
    or a bazaar (3+ normal stores)
  items are sorted by rarity
  shops half full
  generated item count is fixed when level is generated, and is multiplied by store stability factor (10?)

  adventurer
    evenly balanced
  wanderer
    minimal equipment and skills, but highly adaptable
  adept

disciplines
  abilities are gained with experience, and don't come immediately
    based on levels gained after starting the discipline study
    can only study one discipline at a time, but can change without loss
    provide permanent abilities (which usually cost some resource)
  slow master
    abilities based on speed difference
  equip master
  magic master
  vision master
    can sense things through walls, under ground, etc
  growth master
    allows adjusting growth points
    faster growth rate, depending on level of discipline gained
  travel master
    provides teleportation abilities, even across dimensions
  time master
    cheap power: foresight
      can test a future, which automatically rewinds after time limit expires
    strong power: checkpoint rewind (must happen before death)
    super strong power: second chance (must be cast before dying), will rewind a short time before death should death occur
  spirit master
    can't carry equipment unless possessing another creature
    can move from one creature to another
    must store up enough energy before dying to be able to possess another 
    leaving before dying is better, since death causes a backlash greatly reducing the spirits power
multiple species
  change species through polymorph potions
    normally they are temporary, but there are special scrolls that can make them permanent
      start with one permanent scroll
spells
friendly and neutral creatures
multiplayer observation

  snapshots of variables

multiplayer in same dungeon
  taking over another player
  forking another player
  playing with a separate character
  real time simultaneous changes, but each player that moves gives the level a turn also
    maybe disabled when monsters are around?
experience / levels
  each level up gives growth points
    5 per level?
  every 10 levels gives a chance of a energy core awakening
    one core becomes a producer, randomly chosen
      you can alter the chances to some degree
      influenced by amount of energy in each energy pool
      may be the same core twice, which doubles the output of that energy
  growth points expand any given property by 10%
  if species changes, then base changes, but same growth is applied to it
leaving a floor causes time to stop for that floor. When returning to that floor, time is advanced based on how much time the player was away, up to a maximum amount
identification
  potions, scrolls, wands, weapons, armor, rings, etc.  are not identified at first
  identification scrolls are rare
  items are auto identified based on level of item and skills of the player
    if they have skills for that item
    if they have high int
    if they have curse recognition skills?
    if they have rarity recognition skills
    if they have special insight mutation
