  where does it come from?
    dungeon core generates energy for the dungeon
      always one color
  tiers 0-3

      White (tier 3)

      dArk gray (tier 1)
        connects to any spectra or black

      stamina (from orange)
      mana (from yellow)
  energy can flow both directions, but favors down (2x pressure on top)
  willpower can be used to concentrate energy against the normal forces
    effectively reduces the pressure of the targeted energy pool
      1/2 = 1 willpower per aut
      1/3 = 2 willpower per aut
      1/4 = 3 willpower per aut
      1/5 = 4 willpower per aut
    willpower slowly charges over time
  humans have a single spectra core, which continuously generates energy of that color
    with normal adventure mode, spectra core isn't identified until later in the game (when magic awakening happens)
      a second awakening may be possible, based on intelligence
    ? with creature selection mode, spectra core may be chosen at the beginning, along with species, etc
  energy should not pass from one pool to another unless the result would make the pressure difference lower
  energy passes through cells of the dungeon
    each cell may have containers for one or more energy types
    adjacent cells are connected, and based on the cell flow rate, can share energy
    levels have an energy core, unless it is dug up
    plants derive energy from the floor
    some kinds of energy can spawn monsters
    some plants can convert one type of energy to another
    some creatures convert energy
    energy capacity of plants is lower than animals
eat
  starvation constantly attempts to deplete HP, MP, SP (not WP)
    red, orange, yellow energy is consumed to counter this, unless there is no energy available, in which case hp is lost
    there is an idle rate that these deplete, although it is slow
    HP = 0 : dead
    MP = 0 : occasional confusion
    SP = 0 : occasional fainting
  critical health must be at max before major healing can happen
  major health must be at max before minor healing can happen
  normally major damage isn't done until minor health is 0
  all 100/100/100 of 250
  or 1/2 minor 1/4 major 1/4 critical
  or 2/3 minor 1/3 of remaining major + critical, 1/3 of remaining critical
  all health must be 0 before death occurs
  critical strikes can bypass the normal damage order

  wands: convert energy into a single spell, without needing intelligence
  runes: alters attribute of holder permanently while carrying it, or item it's installed into
  gems: stores or converts energy
    if a player equips a gem in their hand, it connects with the native container of the player of the same color

shops
  travelling merchants
    prices are somewhat random
    (but show average over 1 day, 1 week, etc)
  fixed shops
    They can buy and sell, but price is based on demand
      each item has a container size, and min and max price, based on how full that capacity is
    merchant level determines capacity
      L1 = 10
      L2 = 30
      L3 = 100
      L4 = 300
      L5 = 1000
    merchants must make profit (10%)
    normal merchants get random buyers or sellers
    pawn shops don't ever change stock. You will always be able to buy the item back

scenarios
  (rich man)
    mediocre skills, but vast wealth to be able to buy the finest equipment
    starts with decent equip
  prodigy (super talent)
    meager starting equipment, but amazing talent from the beginning
  adventurer
    evenly balanced
  wanderer
    minimal equipment and skills, but highly adaptable
  spirit
    can't carry equipment unless possessing another creature
    can move from one creature to another
    must store up enough energy before dying to be able to possess another 
    leaving before dying is better, since death causes a backlash greatly reducing the spirits power
  time traveller
    modest equip and skills, but can rewind time at any point using a special time energy
    cheap power: foresight
      can test a future, which automatically rewinds after time limit expires
    strong power: checkpoint rewind (must happen before death)
    super strong power: death pause (must be cast before dying), will rewind a short time before death should death occur
