energy management
  where does it come from?
    dungeon core generates energy for the dungeon
      always one color
  tiers 0-4
    1 tier 4 = 10 tier 3 = 100 tier 2 = 1000 tier 1 = 10000 tier 0
  energy types
    lumina
      white: Sun (tier 4)
        connects to *all* etherea
        element = high life
      white: Moon (tier 3)
        connects to *all* spectra
        element = low life
      white: sTar (tier 2)
        connects to any etherea
        element = light
      gray (tier 1)
        connects to any spectra
        element = shadow
      blacK (tier 0)
        connects to any interna
        element = void
    etherea (tier 3)
      Diamond (cyan, blue, indigo, violet, red)
      goLd (yellow, green, cyan, blue)

      critical_health (from violet)
      major_health (from green)
      minor_health (from red)
      stamina (from orange)
      mana (from yellow)
      willpower
  energy can flow both directions, but favors down (2x pressure on top)
  willpower can be used to concentrate energy against the normal forces
    effectively reduces the pressure of the targeted energy pool
      1/2 = 1 willpower per aut
      1/3 = 2 willpower per aut
      1/4 = 3 willpower per aut
      1/5 = 4 willpower per aut
      can only be applied to energy pools, not interna
    willpower is gained from successful activities
      killing a monster
      discovering valuable items
      achievements
      successful spell casting
      successful weapon strike
      successful dodge or deflect or block
      scroll of motivation
      most food gives a small amount of willpower
        dessert food gives larger amount: chocolate, cake, etc
      stealth success
    willpower is drained by 
      being hit
      pain
      spells failing
      fear
      stealth detection
  energy should not pass from one pool to another unless the result would make the pressure difference lower
  energy passes through cells of the dungeon
    each cell may have containers for one or more energy types
    adjacent cells are connected, and based on the cell flow rate, can share energy
    levels have an energy core, unless it is dug up
    plants derive energy from the floor
    some kinds of energy can spawn monsters
    some plants can convert one type of energy to another
    some creatures convert energy
    energy capacity of plants is lower than animals
eat
  starvation constantly attempts to deplete HP, MP, SP (not WP)
    red, orange, yellow energy is consumed to counter this, unless there is no energy available, in which case hp is lost
    there is an idle rate that these deplete, although it is slow
    HP = 0 : dead
    MP = 0 : occasional confusion
    SP = 0 : occasional fainting
  critical health must be at max before major healing can happen
  major health must be at max before minor healing can happen
  normally major damage isn't done until minor health is 0
  all 100/100/100 of 250
  or 1/2 minor 1/4 major 1/4 critical
  or 2/3 minor 1/3 of remaining major + critical, 1/3 of remaining critical
  all health must be 0 before death occurs
  critical strikes can bypass the normal damage order

  forces hold forms in place
    they can be weakened or reversed

    then increase force resisting change after, to make change persistent

  scrolls @: can cast any spell without energy as long as there's enough intelligence. But it takes more time than most actions
  wands /: convert mp into a single spell, without needing intelligence. Takes very little time. No charges
  rings =:
    attribute: boost that attribute
    pool: increase size of that pool
  amulets -: much more powerful than rings, but only one can be worn, and it takes more time to take effect

    pearl: white

shops
  fixed shops
  monsters can't enter
  player can't attack when inside of a shop
  can they heal, read scrolls, etc?
  dropping item onto floor sells it
  picking item up buys it
  They can buy and sell, but price is based on demand
    price of every item is based on how many are held by shops throughout the dungeon
    the more of a given type of item, the cheaper it is
    if you sell an item, that item's price becomes lower, since there is more supply. But calculated price is what the value is after it was sold, making re-buy price = sell price
    sell price != buy price for a single item at one time
  merchants occupy real level space: 
    1/2   3x3
    1/4   4x4
    1/8   5x5
    1/16  6x6
    1/32  7x7
    1/64  8x8
    1/64  9x9
    <5x5 is usually a speciality store
    >=5x5 is usually a general store (although there's a small chance of the opposite)
  buy, then reselling must always be the same price
  total price is product of several factors
    rarity based: (rarity_factor = (1 + count of that type) / total_items_spawned)
      item class: potion, weapon, armor, scroll...
      item type: spear, axe, dagger...
      item enhancement level: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
      item brand: fire, ice, none
    scale based: (rarity_factor = 1/(1+level))
      item level
      item charge
      socket count
    inverting the product of the rarity_factors gives the actual price of the product
  every 3 floors should have a store
  every 3 stores should be a mega-store
    either a large store (6+)
    or a bazaar (3+ normal stores)
  items are sorted by rarity
  shops half full
  generated item count is fixed when level is generated, and is multiplied by store stability factor (10?)
consume item

experience / levels
  every 10 levels gives a chance of a energy core awakening
    one core becomes a producer, randomly chosen
      you can alter the chances to some degree
      influenced by amount of energy in each energy pool
      may be the same core twice, which doubles the output of that energy
  growth points expand any given property by 10%

challenge / defense calculation
  diff = challenge - defense 
  power = 2^(diff/4)
  chance = power/(power+1)

  min_damage = 0
